# What's next

> **Status (337 milestones):** the big arcs below are now DONE — a from-scratch
> **TLS 1.3 client** browses the real HTTPS web with X.509 chain validation, a
> **comprehensive from-scratch JavaScript engine** (full OOP + ES6 + regex +
> Map/Set/Date) runs in the shell and in pages, and the browser is **fully
> interactive**: a minimal DOM (`getElementById`/`querySelector` →
> `textContent`/`innerHTML`/`.value`/`getAttribute`/`setAttribute`),
> `window.location`, inline `onclick`, the complete form-input set
> (text/password/checkbox/radio/hidden/submit/button), **GET form submission +
> live web search (DuckDuckGo) + address-bar search**, and reactive events
> (`onchange`/`oninput`).
>
> **M302–337 added a small CSS engine and a big app suite:** the browser now has
> a real (if small) **CSS engine** — per-element `color`/`font-weight`/
> `font-style`/`text-decoration` from inline `style=` *and* `<style>` rules
> (`tag`/`.class`/`#id`/`[attr]` selectors), `rgb()`/named colours, a real cascade
> and a nesting scope stack — and the start/help/index pages are styled by it.
> Userspace grew to **twenty apps** via a `sys_setcolor` palette: new ones are
> Sudoku, a Calendar, a Mandelbrot explorer, a Piano, a Maze, a text Adventure, a
> Matrix screensaver, an ASCII Paint (saves/loads files), Hangman, and a music
> Jukebox; the games are colourised and several keep persistent high scores. Only
> CSS *layout* (font-size/text-align/box model) still needs a layout engine.
>
> **M216–260 rounded the JavaScript language + stdlib out to near-completeness**
> (found by systematic probing): the full operator set (`delete`/`in`/
> `instanceof`/`**`/bitwise `^`·`~`/`void`), all compound + logical assignments
> (`&=`…`**=`, `||=`/`&&=`/`??=`), binary/octal/exponent + `_`-separated number
> literals, modern classes (**public instance fields + static methods/fields**),
> computed method names, tagged templates, `typeof undeclared`→`"undefined"`, the
> **`arguments`** object, **Error/TypeError/RangeError/SyntaxError** objects,
> spread of `Set`/`Map`, a full **`Date`** (getTime/valueOf/getDay/
> getMilliseconds + `Date.now()` + setFullYear…setSeconds), and a stdlib that now
> covers essentially every common synchronous method — String (replaceAll,
> matchAll, padStart/End, trimStart/End, at, slice/substring edge cases),
> Array (map/filter/reduce/reduceRight, flat(depth)/flatMap, findLast, at, **the
> ES2023 immutable `with`/`toReversed`/`toSorted`/`toSpliced`**), Object
> (keys/values/entries/assign/fromEntries/freeze/**is**), Number (isInteger/
> parseInt/parseFloat/toFixed/toString-radix/MAX_SAFE_INTEGER), Math (hypot/log2/
> cbrt/clz32/imul/sign), and JSON (pretty `stringify` with indent + `parse`). See
> the milestone table in `README.md` for M139–263.
>
> **The clean stdlib AND the object model are now complete.** M261–263 added the
> last big language pieces — all SHIP-reviewed: **getters/setters** (accessor
> properties in object literals *and* classes), **`Object.defineProperty`/
> `getOwnPropertyDescriptor`**, and a real **prototype chain** (`Object.create`,
> function `.prototype` + `new F()` for plain constructors, `__proto__`,
> `getPrototypeOf`/`setPrototypeOf`). The prototype chain is **additive** — walked
> only at the evaluator's member sites after an own-miss, so `delete`/enumeration
> stay own-only and the class system is byte-identical.
>
> **M264–271 hardened and completed the engine:** `in`/`instanceof` now walk the
> prototype chain; `Object.defineProperties` + `Object.create(proto, descriptors)`;
> `structuredClone` (cycle-preserving deep clone); the `Array(n)`/`new Array(…)`
> constructor; `>>>`/`>>>=` (completing the operator + compound-assignment sets);
> and **loose `==`/`!=` vs strict `===`/`!==`** (the `x==null` idiom + coercion).
> Systematic probing of the mature engine also surfaced and fixed real
> pre-existing bugs: `{}===​{}` returned `true` (objects compared via `to_num`→0),
> string `<`/`>` was always `false` (coerced to 0), `1===true` was `true`, and
> `arr.length =` was ignored.
>
> **M281–283 added `querySelector`/`querySelectorAll`/`getElementsByTagName`/
> `getElementsByClassName` by CSS selector** (`tag`/`.class`/`#id`/compounds) +
> `getAttribute` + WRITE (`textContent`/`innerHTML`/`setAttribute`/`remove`) on
> matches — **without** a DOM tree. The "an id-less match has no name to address
> it by" blocker is solved with **byte-offset position handles** (the matched
> `<`'s offset in `vals[1]`), fully additive (the id path stays byte-identical),
> with the write splice duplicated from the id path and the offset re-validated
> each use (memory-safe; single-match writes exact, multi-write best-effort). So
> the common selector-query DOM API is now covered on the token-stream renderer;
> only node *construction* still needs the tree.
>
> What remains is either *fundamentally blocked by the integer-only Number*
> (`Math.random`, float math, `isFinite`/full `isNaN` — all need a NaN /
> floating-point representation we deliberately don't have) or genuinely
> *architectural*: **CSS layout** (a real box/layout engine), **generators/
> iterators**, **async/Promises**, **modules**, **Proxy**, **`Symbol`**. (The DOM
> itself is now **comprehensively complete** — M281–299 delivered queries,
> traversal [matches/closest/children/parentElement], attributes [get/set/has/
> remove + classList], read/write, **node construction** [createElement/appendChild
> — which turned out NOT to need a tree, via innerHTML-reuse], and the full
> event-handler lifecycle [onclick/addEventListener/onchange/oninput, add/fire/
> remove] on a persistent per-page JS env. And **a small CSS engine now exists**
> — M302–305: per-element `color` / `font-weight` / `font-style` from inline
> `style=` *and* `<style>` rules (`tag`/`.class`/`#id`/`[attr]` selectors), with
> a real cascade and a scope **stack** so styled elements nest to any depth. Only
> CSS *layout* — `font-size`, `text-align`, the box model, backgrounds — still
> needs a layout engine the token-stream renderer lacks; the *machinery* of CSS
> [selectors, cascade, nesting] is done.)

OS-DEV is a **graphical desktop OS** (337 milestones). It boots to a themed
windowing desktop with a **taskbar** that hosts ten **real ring-3 userspace
programs** as windows — a shell, a clock, a calculator, a text editor, and six
games (Snake, 2048, Life, Tetris, Breakout, Minesweeper) — plus a **graphical web
browser**. Under the hood:
preemptive multitasking with sleep/wake and **per-process isolation**, a
read-write **FAT32** filesystem with **subdirectories** and a full file toolkit,
a from-scratch **TCP/HTTP** stack that fetches real web pages (redirects +
chunked transfer-encoding), verified **SHA-256 / AES-128** crypto, sound, a
real-time clock, USB pointer, arrow keys + command history, and a compositor
that caches the scene so cursor moves are cheap.

```

The browser is now **fully keyboard-drivable**: Tab/n/p to select links, Enter
to follow, Backspace to go back, `a` to bookmark, `s` to save, `/` to edit the
address, PgUp/PgDn to page, `\` for in-page find, `h` for home, `g`/`G` for
top/bottom. It renders headings, bold/italic, inline `<code>`, **colour text**,
links, **numbered & nested lists, tables, `<pre>`, form fields, and real PNG,
GIF and JPEG images rendered inline in the page** (from-scratch DEFLATE/PNG +
LZW/GIF + baseline-JPEG decoders, host-tested and fuzzed), and decodes HTML
entities (named + decimal + hex). The WM has keyboard window management: **F2**
cycles focus, **F4**
maximizes/restores; the **Files window is an interactive launcher** (arrows +
Enter open a file in the browser); apps have **scrollback** (PgUp/PgDn). The OS
can also **load and run ELF programs from the disk** (`run calc.elf`), not just
the kernel-embedded ones.

Shell toolkit: `ls cat edit write rm cp mv mkdir cd pwd tree find grep df
hexdump wc cal sha256 crypt base64 run get wget browse echo date ping resolve
beep mem ps clear reboot ver pid exit`.

## The biggest remaining gaps

1. **Browser interactivity — LARGELY DONE; the frontier has moved.** The browser
   browses the real HTTPS web (from-scratch **TLS 1.3** + X.509 chain validation to
   baked-in roots — `TLS*` on example.com/NPR/gnu.org/google.com), runs a
   **comprehensive JS engine** (OOP + ES6 + regex + Map/Set/Date), and is now
   **interactive**: a minimal **DOM** (`getElementById`/`querySelector` →
   `textContent`/`innerHTML`/`.value`, `getAttribute`/`setAttribute`),
   `window.location`, inline `onclick`, the full **form-input set**, **GET form
   submission**, **live web search** (DuckDuckGo, from a form or the address bar),
   and **reactive events** (`onchange`/`oninput`). What's left for *more*
   interactivity — each a real build, best done with guidance:
   - **Event handlers — DONE (M287–292)**: a persistent per-page JS env + a handler
     registry; the full lifecycle works — `onclick`/`addEventListener`/`onchange`/
     `oninput` (inline *and* JS-assigned), add / fire (with an `event` arg + `this`) /
     remove (`removeEventListener`/`onclick=null`), state persisting across events.
     (Minor polish left: id-less-element handlers, multiple listeners per event.)
   - **DOM queries + traversal + element API + construction — DONE (M281–299)**:
     querySelector(All)/getElementsBy* by CSS selector (tag/`.class`/`#id`/`[attr]`/
     compounds); traversal `matches`/`closest`/`children`/`parentElement`; attributes
     `get`/`has`/`set`/`removeAttribute` + `classList`; textContent/innerHTML/value
     read+write, `remove`; and **node construction** `createElement`+`appendChild`
     (turned out NOT to need a tree — `parent.innerHTML += built-HTML`). All via
     byte-offset *position handles*.
   - **CSS — a small engine DONE (M302–305)**: per-element `color` / `font-weight`
     / `font-style` from inline `style=` *and* `<style>` rules (`tag`/`.class`/`#id`/
     `[attr]` selectors), a real cascade (rules < inline, per property), and a scope
     **stack** so styled elements nest to any depth. Only CSS *layout* — `font-size`,
     `text-align`, the box model, backgrounds — still needs a layout engine the flat
     token-stream renderer lacks. Possible next slivers without one: `rgb()`/more named
     colours, `text-decoration` (underline/line-through).
   - **CSS / layout**, cookies (sessions), inline remote `<img>`, `<textarea>`
     multiline.
   *Known limit: `lite.cnn.com` etc. refuse our minimal ClientHello (Fastly TLS
   fingerprinting) — not a TCP/crypto bug. Hard ceiling stands: real web apps
   (Google Docs) / Chromium are out of reach — see GOALS.md.*
2. **`fork` / `exec` + a process table.** Programs spawn fresh from embedded or
   on-disk ELFs (loading from disk now works — milestone 85); true `fork` +
   `exec` would enable a Unix-like model with child processes.
3. **Richer browser rendering.** **Inline `<img>` for remote (`http:`) images**
   (local images render inline — milestone 111; remote ones still need an async
   per-image fetch state machine on top of the single fetch worker/buffer),
   hanging-indent list wrap, and true column-aligned tables. (`<pre>`, lists,
   tables, entities, bold/italic, headings, links, form fields, text colour,
   inline code, `<img>` sizing, **inline local PNG (incl. interlaced), GIF (incl.
   animation), and baseline-and-progressive JPEG images**, and the full-page
   image viewer are all done — three from-scratch image decoders, host-tested and
   fuzzed. Every common web image format is supported.)
4. **Long file names** (subdirectories exist, but 8.3 names only).

## Smaller polish

- Window **minimize** (F3) + tiling/snap (F5/F6) are done; terminal copy/paste (scrollback is done).
- Browser: scrollbar drag, in-page find, history forward (Back exists).
- A graphical **file manager** with icons (the Files window is now an
  interactive launcher); load the wallpaper from disk.
- **APIC/HPET** + SMP (multi-core); faster syscalls (`syscall`/`sysret`).

## Notes

- Per-milestone learning docs are in `docs/00`…`docs/78`; the table in
  `README.md` indexes them. Screenshots are the `docs/osdev-*.png` files.
- Long-term north stars (a full browser, running Claude Code) and the
  pure-from-scratch vs Linux-compatible decision are analyzed in `GOALS.md`.
- Testing is headless: QEMU `-display none -monitor stdio` + `sendkey`, screendump
  → PNG. The browser and WM are now keyboard-driven, so they're fully scriptable.
