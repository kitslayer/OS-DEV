# What's next

OS-DEV is a **graphical desktop OS** (100 milestones). It boots to a themed
windowing desktop with a **taskbar** that hosts eight **real ring-3 userspace
programs** as windows — a shell, a clock, a calculator, a text editor, and four
games (Snake, 2048, Life, Tetris) — plus a **graphical web browser**. Under the
hood:
preemptive multitasking with sleep/wake and **per-process isolation**, a
read-write **FAT32** filesystem with **subdirectories** and a full file toolkit,
a from-scratch **TCP/HTTP** stack that fetches real web pages (redirects +
chunked transfer-encoding), verified **SHA-256 / AES-128** crypto, sound, a
real-time clock, USB pointer, arrow keys + command history, and a compositor
that caches the scene so cursor moves are cheap.

```

The browser is now **fully keyboard-drivable**: Tab/n/p to select links, Enter
to follow, Backspace to go back, `a` to bookmark, `s` to save, `/` to edit the
address, PgUp/PgDn to page, `\` for in-page find, `h` for home, `g`/`G` for
top/bottom. It renders headings, bold/italic, inline `<code>`, **colour text**,
links, **numbered & nested lists, tables, `<pre>`, form fields, and real PNG,
GIF and JPEG images rendered inline in the page** (from-scratch DEFLATE/PNG +
LZW/GIF + baseline-JPEG decoders, host-tested and fuzzed), and decodes HTML
entities (named + decimal + hex). The WM has keyboard window management: **F2**
cycles focus, **F4**
maximizes/restores; the **Files window is an interactive launcher** (arrows +
Enter open a file in the browser); apps have **scrollback** (PgUp/PgDn). The OS
can also **load and run ELF programs from the disk** (`run calc.elf`), not just
the kernel-embedded ones.

Shell toolkit: `ls cat edit write rm cp mv mkdir cd pwd tree find grep df
hexdump wc cal sha256 crypt base64 run get wget browse echo date ping resolve
beep mem ps clear reboot ver pid exit`.

## The biggest remaining gaps

1. **Browser interactivity — the real frontier now (HTTPS + page-JS already work).**
   The browser **browses the real HTTPS web** with a from-scratch **TLS 1.3 client**
   that does **full X.509 cert-chain validation to baked-in trusted roots** (the
   `TLS*` badge — example.com, NPR, gnu.org, google.com), and it **runs JavaScript**:
   pages execute their `<script>` at load (`document.write`) and `<a href="javascript:…">`
   links run JS on click, via a from-scratch JS engine (`kernel/js.c`). The engine is
   now genuinely capable — closures, arrow functions, template literals,
   switch/do-while/for-of/for-in, try/catch/finally/throw, **full class-based OOP
   (`class`/`extends`/`super`, `this`, `new`)**, **ES6 spread/rest `...` and
   destructuring**, a Math/JSON/String/Array stdlib, and a browser-owned
   **`localStorage`** so click handlers keep state across runs (all verified in-OS:
   `CLASS.JS`, `ES6.JS`, `OOP.HTM`, `JSCLICK.HTM`). What's still missing for *real
   interactivity*:
   - **A minimal DOM** — `getElementById`/`querySelector`, `element.textContent`/
     `.innerHTML`, and element `onclick` that *mutates existing nodes* (not just
     `document.write`). The renderer is a flat token stream, not a DOM tree, so this
     is a real build (the next big, risky one — best done with guidance).
   - Then: forms that submit (GET → query string), cookies (sessions), remote `<img>`.
   *Known limit: `lite.cnn.com` and similar refuse our minimal ClientHello (Fastly
   TLS fingerprinting) — not a TCP/crypto bug; our stack validates Cloudflare/Let's-
   Encrypt/DigiCert/GTS. And the hard ceiling stands: real web apps (Google Docs) /
   Chromium are out of reach — see GOALS.md.*
2. **`fork` / `exec` + a process table.** Programs spawn fresh from embedded or
   on-disk ELFs (loading from disk now works — milestone 85); true `fork` +
   `exec` would enable a Unix-like model with child processes.
3. **Richer browser rendering.** **Inline `<img>` for remote (`http:`) images**
   (local images render inline — milestone 111; remote ones still need an async
   per-image fetch state machine on top of the single fetch worker/buffer),
   hanging-indent list wrap, and true column-aligned tables. (`<pre>`, lists,
   tables, entities, bold/italic, headings, links, form fields, text colour,
   inline code, `<img>` sizing, **inline local PNG (incl. interlaced), GIF (incl.
   animation), and baseline-and-progressive JPEG images**, and the full-page
   image viewer are all done — three from-scratch image decoders, host-tested and
   fuzzed. Every common web image format is supported.)
4. **Long file names** (subdirectories exist, but 8.3 names only).

## Smaller polish

- Window **minimize** (F3) + tiling/snap (F5/F6) are done; terminal copy/paste (scrollback is done).
- Browser: scrollbar drag, in-page find, history forward (Back exists).
- A graphical **file manager** with icons (the Files window is now an
  interactive launcher); load the wallpaper from disk.
- **APIC/HPET** + SMP (multi-core); faster syscalls (`syscall`/`sysret`).

## Notes

- Per-milestone learning docs are in `docs/00`…`docs/78`; the table in
  `README.md` indexes them. Screenshots are the `docs/osdev-*.png` files.
- Long-term north stars (a full browser, running Claude Code) and the
  pure-from-scratch vs Linux-compatible decision are analyzed in `GOALS.md`.
- Testing is headless: QEMU `-display none -monitor stdio` + `sendkey`, screendump
  → PNG. The browser and WM are now keyboard-driven, so they're fully scriptable.
