# What's next

> **Status (260 milestones):** the big arcs below are now DONE — a from-scratch
> **TLS 1.3 client** browses the real HTTPS web with X.509 chain validation, a
> **comprehensive from-scratch JavaScript engine** (full OOP + ES6 + regex +
> Map/Set/Date) runs in the shell and in pages, and the browser is **fully
> interactive**: a minimal DOM (`getElementById`/`querySelector` →
> `textContent`/`innerHTML`/`.value`/`getAttribute`/`setAttribute`),
> `window.location`, inline `onclick`, the complete form-input set
> (text/password/checkbox/radio/hidden/submit/button), **GET form submission +
> live web search (DuckDuckGo) + address-bar search**, and reactive events
> (`onchange`/`oninput`).
>
> **M216–260 rounded the JavaScript language + stdlib out to near-completeness**
> (found by systematic probing): the full operator set (`delete`/`in`/
> `instanceof`/`**`/bitwise `^`·`~`/`void`), all compound + logical assignments
> (`&=`…`**=`, `||=`/`&&=`/`??=`), binary/octal/exponent + `_`-separated number
> literals, modern classes (**public instance fields + static methods/fields**),
> computed method names, tagged templates, `typeof undeclared`→`"undefined"`, the
> **`arguments`** object, **Error/TypeError/RangeError/SyntaxError** objects,
> spread of `Set`/`Map`, a full **`Date`** (getTime/valueOf/getDay/
> getMilliseconds + `Date.now()` + setFullYear…setSeconds), and a stdlib that now
> covers essentially every common synchronous method — String (replaceAll,
> matchAll, padStart/End, trimStart/End, at, slice/substring edge cases),
> Array (map/filter/reduce/reduceRight, flat(depth)/flatMap, findLast, at, **the
> ES2023 immutable `with`/`toReversed`/`toSorted`/`toSpliced`**), Object
> (keys/values/entries/assign/fromEntries/freeze/**is**), Number (isInteger/
> parseInt/parseFloat/toFixed/toString-radix/MAX_SAFE_INTEGER), Math (hypot/log2/
> cbrt/clz32/imul/sign), and JSON (pretty `stringify` with indent + `parse`). See
> the milestone table in `README.md` for M139–260.

OS-DEV is a **graphical desktop OS** (260 milestones). It boots to a themed
windowing desktop with a **taskbar** that hosts ten **real ring-3 userspace
programs** as windows — a shell, a clock, a calculator, a text editor, and six
games (Snake, 2048, Life, Tetris, Breakout, Minesweeper) — plus a **graphical web
browser**. Under the hood:
preemptive multitasking with sleep/wake and **per-process isolation**, a
read-write **FAT32** filesystem with **subdirectories** and a full file toolkit,
a from-scratch **TCP/HTTP** stack that fetches real web pages (redirects +
chunked transfer-encoding), verified **SHA-256 / AES-128** crypto, sound, a
real-time clock, USB pointer, arrow keys + command history, and a compositor
that caches the scene so cursor moves are cheap.

```

The browser is now **fully keyboard-drivable**: Tab/n/p to select links, Enter
to follow, Backspace to go back, `a` to bookmark, `s` to save, `/` to edit the
address, PgUp/PgDn to page, `\` for in-page find, `h` for home, `g`/`G` for
top/bottom. It renders headings, bold/italic, inline `<code>`, **colour text**,
links, **numbered & nested lists, tables, `<pre>`, form fields, and real PNG,
GIF and JPEG images rendered inline in the page** (from-scratch DEFLATE/PNG +
LZW/GIF + baseline-JPEG decoders, host-tested and fuzzed), and decodes HTML
entities (named + decimal + hex). The WM has keyboard window management: **F2**
cycles focus, **F4**
maximizes/restores; the **Files window is an interactive launcher** (arrows +
Enter open a file in the browser); apps have **scrollback** (PgUp/PgDn). The OS
can also **load and run ELF programs from the disk** (`run calc.elf`), not just
the kernel-embedded ones.

Shell toolkit: `ls cat edit write rm cp mv mkdir cd pwd tree find grep df
hexdump wc cal sha256 crypt base64 run get wget browse echo date ping resolve
beep mem ps clear reboot ver pid exit`.

## The biggest remaining gaps

1. **Browser interactivity — LARGELY DONE; the frontier has moved.** The browser
   browses the real HTTPS web (from-scratch **TLS 1.3** + X.509 chain validation to
   baked-in roots — `TLS*` on example.com/NPR/gnu.org/google.com), runs a
   **comprehensive JS engine** (OOP + ES6 + regex + Map/Set/Date), and is now
   **interactive**: a minimal **DOM** (`getElementById`/`querySelector` →
   `textContent`/`innerHTML`/`.value`, `getAttribute`/`setAttribute`),
   `window.location`, inline `onclick`, the full **form-input set**, **GET form
   submission**, **live web search** (DuckDuckGo, from a form or the address bar),
   and **reactive events** (`onchange`/`oninput`). What's left for *more*
   interactivity — each a real build, best done with guidance:
   - **`addEventListener` / `el.onclick = fn`** (JS-assigned handlers) — needs a
     *persistent per-page JS env* (the arena resets per run, no GC), so a function
     defined at load can fire on a later event. The deepest remaining DOM change.
   - **`querySelectorAll` / `getElementsByTagName`** — needs *position-based* element
     handles (today's handles are keyed by `id`, so id-less matches can't be
     addressed); **`createElement`/`appendChild`** — needs a real DOM tree (the
     renderer is a flat token stream).
   - **CSS / layout**, cookies (sessions), inline remote `<img>`, `<textarea>`
     multiline.
   *Known limit: `lite.cnn.com` etc. refuse our minimal ClientHello (Fastly TLS
   fingerprinting) — not a TCP/crypto bug. Hard ceiling stands: real web apps
   (Google Docs) / Chromium are out of reach — see GOALS.md.*
2. **`fork` / `exec` + a process table.** Programs spawn fresh from embedded or
   on-disk ELFs (loading from disk now works — milestone 85); true `fork` +
   `exec` would enable a Unix-like model with child processes.
3. **Richer browser rendering.** **Inline `<img>` for remote (`http:`) images**
   (local images render inline — milestone 111; remote ones still need an async
   per-image fetch state machine on top of the single fetch worker/buffer),
   hanging-indent list wrap, and true column-aligned tables. (`<pre>`, lists,
   tables, entities, bold/italic, headings, links, form fields, text colour,
   inline code, `<img>` sizing, **inline local PNG (incl. interlaced), GIF (incl.
   animation), and baseline-and-progressive JPEG images**, and the full-page
   image viewer are all done — three from-scratch image decoders, host-tested and
   fuzzed. Every common web image format is supported.)
4. **Long file names** (subdirectories exist, but 8.3 names only).

## Smaller polish

- Window **minimize** (F3) + tiling/snap (F5/F6) are done; terminal copy/paste (scrollback is done).
- Browser: scrollbar drag, in-page find, history forward (Back exists).
- A graphical **file manager** with icons (the Files window is now an
  interactive launcher); load the wallpaper from disk.
- **APIC/HPET** + SMP (multi-core); faster syscalls (`syscall`/`sysret`).

## Notes

- Per-milestone learning docs are in `docs/00`…`docs/78`; the table in
  `README.md` indexes them. Screenshots are the `docs/osdev-*.png` files.
- Long-term north stars (a full browser, running Claude Code) and the
  pure-from-scratch vs Linux-compatible decision are analyzed in `GOALS.md`.
- Testing is headless: QEMU `-display none -monitor stdio` + `sendkey`, screendump
  → PNG. The browser and WM are now keyboard-driven, so they're fully scriptable.
